title: A letter for you
---
**At a cold night,the moon was hanging on. When I was reciting the words with the warm air-condition. A special idea occurred in my head,why not to build a website only for study？**

**After that I searched through all the internet found  good solution, Based on vuepress(base on vue) engine to build it. Armed with powerful vue engine push me to make this idea come true.**
**Dering the building. I met amount of issues，sometime even wanted to give up. But finally , with my full of ambition's heart, I did it! A not complex but fancy website was born! So,that's why you can see this letter.** 

**Last but not least, I wish you can join us,so that we can build this website together and makes it better and better.**
