title: A letter for you
---
**On a cold night, the moon was hanging on. When I was reciting the words with the warm air-conditioner, a special idea occurred in my head. Why not build a website only for studying?**

**After that, I searched through all the Internet. I found a good solution. Based on vuepress(based on vue) engine to build it. Armed with a powerful vue engine pushed me to make this idea come true.**
**During building the website, I met a number of issues, sometimes I even wanted to give up. But finally, with my full ambition's heart, I did it! A not complex but fancy website was born! So, that's why you can see this letter.** 

**Last but not least, I hope you can join us, so that we can build this website together and make it better and better.**
